# Dopey Weaver

*Canned provisioning for (hopefully) easier Python development on Windows*

## Requirements

1. Install [VirtualBox][virtbox]

1. Install [Vagrant][vagrant]

1. Install [Git][gitscm]

1. Put Git's `ssh.exe` onto your PATH

    * You can optionally use a dumb shim like below (placed elsewhere, but
      somewhere that is on the PATH with the name "`ssh.bat`") if you
      don't want to put the whole Git `bin` onto your PATH.

            "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\ssh.exe" %*
